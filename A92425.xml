            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Reat and mighty are the Resolves of the high and imperious States of the Netherlands: no less then 50 new Frigats more are voted upon the stocks, to put forth against the Spring, unless your Parliament can find out a way to repeal that vigorous Act: Where is power and policy? Or Right and Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority; I hope they are not like twisted snakes linkt in conspiracy: God forbid! for now is the time for every true English man to put his hand to the plough, rather then to be allur'd by the rowling flouds of the World, into the common stream of Error and Convenience: Alas! this would be a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:166395:3"/>meanes to dray you to a declension from Freedom; to a Chaos of Confusion.</p>
            <p>Therefore, to draw a little nearer home to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of your own dangers, I conceive it very requisite to remonstrate unto you the warlike pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations of forreign Nations; which summarily, I shall thus contract; to the end, that it may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to all Christian people within your Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories; for by all humane apprehension, Europe renders you in a sad condition; and most of her Princely Powers seem very forward to array them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in a Military posture against your Supremacy and Authority. In short, there's old listing of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in the English court in France, and mighty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions making to bring an Army into these parts; that if possible ere Spring they may be in a capacity and condition to land in England. For the more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile accomplishing whereof, Prince Rupert is gone to the Swedish Court to incite the aid and assistance of the Royal Queen Christiana, and her great coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, for their friendly assistance in carrying on the design of his distressed Kinsman; And, to deal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuously, so much his Rhetorick has wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them already, that he is entertained like a Prince, and his Captains feasted most nobly at the cost and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:166395:3"/>charge of the Nobles; and withall much importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to spend some few dayes more in conference; the result whereof produced these Effects, That so soon as there is a firm League concluded between the Crown of Sweden, and the Duke of Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, her Majesty was resolved to answer his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation. But his Highness being loath to detract any further time, resolved for the Baltick seas, and accordingly with 26 Men of War hoysted sayl, and spread his Canvass, upon his launching forrh into Neptunes Ocean. Which Frederick King of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark hearing of, immediatly gave Order that 30 of his best Frigats should be put into an equipage to receive him, and according to Commission and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions to reinforce the King of Scots Fleet, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Sir George Carteret, and Sir Marma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke Langdale; which done, to act as occasion shall be offered from the English.</p>
            <p>These things were thought worthy of your Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals observation, whose great soul I presume will rather descend to look into this business, wherin his Countrey is so highly concerned, that in respect he hath been a fiery wall for it abroad, so at home he is to become her great Intelligence, to guide those happy motions of her peace and security.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:166395:4"/>
            <p>Truly sir, I conceive it to be a piece of publike gratitude, besides private, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the Negotiations of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths Enemies; so that you may see by what Engines the wheel of the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Interest moves; whose Cause is so hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somly bandied on all sides, that the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees are opiniated to grow great by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration of young Charles; but, indeed, that which casts an odium upon their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent transactions, is, their previous tortures against the English, who contrary to due course of Justice, feigned an Accusation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst one Captain Vere, a Low-countrey souldier, but a faithful Englishman, and one who endeavored to make up the breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Republiques; and at a try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all before some of the Lords, received that dreadful sentence to have his head separated from his shoulders; Upon the pronouncing whereof, he delivered himself to the Judges as followeth:</p>

                  <p>As your inventive sentence is founded upon the Criticisms of sin, so is it the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory of a bloudy Tragedy; and one day you will find that a good Conscience is far more precious then a passionate Revenge. But being interrupted, and receiving a Gag from the President, he was immediatly carryed to the place of Execution, and before the Palace-Royal received the fatal blow, in the presence of the Queen of Bohemia, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of Orange, and divers other honorable Personages; who seem'd not a litle astonish'd at his undanted deportment; for indeed Death was not in the least terrible; his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings he accounted Martyrdom, and his Change glorious. His loss is much lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and it is conceived those who were the chies Instruments to cloud and asperse his innocency, are now the greatest Anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors if it were possible to apply a salvatory
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:166395:5"/>means to the Malady; but alas! too late; though they fain would cloud it with the veil of Apostacy, merely under the type &amp; shadow of Treachery and Conspiracy, &amp;c. But if ye consider, how loud and pressing the cry of bloud is, or with what high seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity God ever proceeds against it, though his wrath for some small time may seem to be asleep, yet there is just cause to fear, that there is a heavy account must be given by the Dutch for that execrable Tyranny of theirs executed.</p>
